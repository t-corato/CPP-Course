Varaible Lifetime 
THe period of time in which a variable is going to be alive in memory 
It becomes alive when you declare it and it is killed from memory at some point

When a variable is killed is decided by its storage duration
- local -> dies at the end of the block 
- static -> dies when program ends
- dynamic -> you decide when it dies 

Variable Scope
A region in your code where a variable name can be mentioned.

Trying to use a variable out of it's scope will result in a compiler error

 Global variable -> accessible everywhere in the code 
 Local variable -> accessible in the block that is defined in

 Nested scope -> a variable defined inside {} is not usable outside but the opposite is possible
